                <p id="stories">COLUMBIA — Anthony Sherrils volunteered first.

He and hundreds of fellow Missouri student-athletes had just sat through a panel hosted by Men4Men, a Missouri athletics initiative that holds one event per semester. All male Tiger athletes are required to attend. The event took place in the lounge area of club seating at Memorial Stadium, where fans pay big to watch guys like Sherrils play. But this event wasn’t for fans. It was for athletes to listen and learn and discuss their feelings. The topic of the panel, as it was advertised on a flier handed out to the athletes: Why are race and racism so hard to discuss?

When the time came for an open discussion among athletes, Sherrils spoke for about five minutes, according to another Missouri athlete at the meeting who remembers Sherrils telling his peers that he felt steered toward an easier degree because he’s a black student-athlete. His comments kicked off a discussion that, at times, became contentious. An hour into the discussion, Missouri football’s strength coach, Pat Ivey, told the athletes they were having a good conversation. Ivey told them to take action.

 “That’s where it first came to our mind, some of the things that were going on.”
Sherrils and his roommate, wide receiver J’Mon Moore, went home that night and talked about the culture at MU, according to Sherrils. They considered becoming more involved with the general student body. “That’s where it first came to our mind, some of the things that were going on,” Moore said. “There was kind of a snowball effect after that.”

That was Oct. 26. Nine days later, on Nov. 4, Moore was driving his car past picturesque Mel Carnahan Quadrangle when a small village of tents and nearby signs piqued his interest. So he parked his car. He walked to the tents and read the signs about a hunger strike. He met a graduate student named Jonathan Butler, who, as part of the student activist group Concerned Student 1950, refused to eat until then University of Missouri System President Tim Wolfe resigned.

“That’s when I really got concerned,” Moore said of the first time he met Butler. The wide receiver said he made “some promises” to the man on the hunger strike.

And three days later, he and 29 other black Missouri football players announced over Twitter that they were boycotting all football activities until the president resigned. A local story became a national one, and by now you probably know how it played out. Missouri coach Gary Pinkel tweeted a photo that Sunday showing the Tigers — both black and white — in solidarity. Wolfe resigned Monday. And Butler ate. The Tigers resumed football activities after missing only one practice and then beat Brigham Young in Kansas City a week after announcing their boycott.</p>
